# hello-world
Just another repository to test out how to use github.

I'm Brenda!
I'm an experimental condensed matter physics graduate student in Minnesota. I study 1/f noise of amorphous and other non-crystalline thin-film semiconductors.

I code in python for 1/f noise data analysis and matlab for simulations (might switch them up, but those are my main tools)!

I'm looking for a space where I can share my codes with people. Perhaps this is it.
